# docker-invoicing
Invoice ninja in docker

## Application Setup
The env file contains the environment we want (prod, test, demo, etc). This is expected as APPENVIRO and we use it in the folder path.
If APPENVIRO=test then installation & container names will have 'test' in them.

cd into the app installation folder (IN5VOL) & create a folder matching APPENVIRO, then
```bash
mkdir -p db
mkdir -p app/public
mkdir -p app/storage
chmod -R 777 app/*
```

The `APP_KEY` can be generated by running

```bash
docker run --rm -it invoiceninja/invoiceninja php artisan key:generate --show
```
