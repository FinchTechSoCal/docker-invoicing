# docker-invoicing
Invoice Ninja v5 in docker

## Application Setup
To not break whatever crazy stuff the designers did, we're going to use the original paths (mostly).
We plan on deploying via portainer, we'll use stack.env as our environment file.
Our env file contains the environment we want (prod, test, demo, etc). This is expected as APPENVIRO and we use it in the folder path.
If APPENVIRO=test then installation & container names will have 'test' in them.

Let's make this easy by setting a bash variables to match 'IN5VOL' & 'APPENVIRO'
```bash
IN5VOL=/home/finchtech/appdata/invoice-ninja
APPENVIRO=test
git clone https://github.com/invoiceninja/dockerfiles.git $IN5VOL/$APPENVIRO
chmod 755 $IN5VOL/$APPENVIRO/docker/app/public
sudo chown -R 1500:1500 $IN5VOL/$APPENVIRO/docker/app
```

Generate an `APP_KEY` for our stack.env file

```bash
docker run --rm -it invoiceninja/invoiceninja php artisan key:generate --show
```



## From the original docs
If `IN_USER_EMAIL` and `IN_PASSWORD` is not set the default user email and password is "admin@example.com" and "changeme!" respectively. You will use this for the initial login, thereafter, you can delete this two environment variables.

The `APP_KEY` can be generated by running

```bash
docker run --rm -it invoiceninja/invoiceninja php artisan key:generate --show
```

Copy the entire string and insert in the env file at `APP_KEY=base64....`

To ensure folder permissions are correct when the container comes up for the first time it is important that you set the correct folder permissions on the `docker` folder.

From the terminal run

```bash
chmod 755 docker/app/public
sudo chown -R 1500:1500 docker/app
```
