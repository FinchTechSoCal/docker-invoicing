# docker-invoicing
Invoice ninja in docker

## Application Setup
The env file contains the environment we want (prod, test, demo, etc). This is expected as APPENVIRO and we use it in the folder path.
If APPENVIRO=test then installation & container names will have 'test' in them.

cd into the app installation folder (IN5VOL) & create a folder matching APPENVIRO, then
```bash
mkdir -p db
mkdir -p app/public
mkdir -p app/storage
chmod -R 777 app/*
```

## From the original docs
If `IN_USER_EMAIL` and `IN_PASSWORD` is not set the default user email and password is "admin@example.com" and "changeme!" respectively. You will use this for the initial login, thereafter, you can delete this two environment variables.

The `APP_KEY` can be generated by running

```bash
docker run --rm -it invoiceninja/invoiceninja php artisan key:generate --show
```

Copy the entire string and insert in the env file at `APP_KEY=base64....`

To ensure folder permissions are correct when the container comes up for the first time it is important that you set the correct folder permissions on the `docker` folder.

From the terminal run

```bash
chmod 755 docker/app/public
sudo chown -R 1500:1500 docker/app
```
